# Hangman

🧠 How It Works

The program imports a list of words from words.py

It randomly chooses one word and hides its letters

You guess letters one by one:

✅ Correct letters appear in the word

❌ Incorrect or repeated letters trigger messages

When you reveal all the letters — you win 🎉

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

random module for word selection

string module for alphabet management
